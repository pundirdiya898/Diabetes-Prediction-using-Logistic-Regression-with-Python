# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression with Python

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental classification technique in machine learning. We use the **Diabetes Dataset** to train and evaluate the model. The workflow includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling), model training, performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC), and prediction.

The project is built with **Python** and popular libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib** for data processing, modeling, and visualization. It serves as a simple, clear example of applying logistic regression to a real-world healthcare dataset.
